## Placeholder Notes
The application references various images that need to be added to this directory:

you can use stock photos or generated images from services like:

- Generated.photos for AI-generated faces for testimonials

## Image Optimization
All images should be optimized for web use before adding to this directory:
- Compress images to reduce file size
- Use appropriate dimensions (carousel: 1600x900px, testimonials: 400x400px)
- Use modern formats like WebP when possible
